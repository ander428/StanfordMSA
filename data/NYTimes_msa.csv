A policeman wielding a shotgun gave the cleric, the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, a count of 10 to pull back 200 yards from the entrance of the township, called Langa. Last Thursday, it was the scene of the worst single mass shootings by the police since the Sharpeville massacre 25 years earlier. A second prominent cleric, the Rev. Beyers Naude, General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, said he was also turned back by heavily armed police at nearby Kwanobuhle Township.",NA,"1985-03-26T00:00:00Z","article","News","4fd1403d8eb7c8105d617c5e",887,"APARTHEID FOE KEPT OUT OF TOWNSHIP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

'Try to Fight Back' ""The simple fact is we have to try to fight back,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""We just can't sit here and let this kind of carnage go on. Gun licensing would help.

Last Friday the school had a giant pep rally, followed Saturday night by a junior-senior prom. Parents had raised $50,000 for a no-alcohol after-prom party, to keep their children safe. It was the kind of school where a teacher last year assigned her students to read about the school shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., to help them understand the real world, because nothing like that could ever happen here. ''I thought we lived in a bubble,'' said Josiah Pina, an 18-year-old senior who played on the championship Rebels football team. And Columbine High School is like a lot of suburban high schools in other ways as well, its 1,870 students divided into a dozen groups, from the jocks and preps who rule the roost to stoners, skaters, freaks and, yes, the trench coat mafia. Among these latter groups, many have chafed for some time at the dominance and arrogance of the jocks. That is to say, Columbine is separated into cliques and classes and ins and outs, as complicated a place as the society beyond. ''There are cliques all over the place,'' said Meg Hains, 16, a sophomore. ''You can't go to high school without cliques.'' Meg and her friends Jessica Jones and Erin Brinkley, both 15, who gathered with her outside the high school today along with hundreds of other students to mourn the victims of the mass shooting by two members of the trench coat mafia, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, classified themselves as their own tiny group, ''the individuals.'' ''We're the outsiders,'' Meg said. The ''individuals'' shun the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, the labels favored by the jocks and preps. ''We vowed we would never wear Abercrombie,'' Jessica said, adding that she would not be able to afford the $30 shirts and the $25 hats even if she liked them. While Columbine is not so affluent as some other schools in the fast-growing prairie suburbs of Denver, there are plenty of students who can afford the labels, and who drive expensive cars. ''One jock has a Hummer,'' the huge, expensive and somewhat otherworldly-looking all-terrain vehicle, Jessica said. ''He totaled one Hummer, and his dad bought him another.'' Jessica, whose father owns a candy store and who does not have her own wheels, was complaining about how the jocks and the preps looked down on her and her friends when Emily Hackett, whose pale green Gap three-quarter-sleeve shirt, Silvertab by Levi jeans and American Eagle sandals clearly marked her as a prep, came up and threw her arms around her. They have been friends since seventh grade. ''People ask me, 'Why do you talk to her?' '' Emily said. ''I say, 'She's cool, she's my bud.' '' Glancing toward Emily, Erin said, ''There's some nice preps.'' Whatever the resentments and jealousies inside Columbine High School, the members of the different groups stood side by side on the grass today, weeping together, hugging and exchanging survivors' stories. Individuals, preps, jocks, freaks and skaters, the students all seemed unusually open and pleasant. They were polite to the huge media pack, patiently answering the same questions over and over. Even in their shock and grief, many were eager to talk about their school. ''Everyone knows Columbine in Colorado,'' said Amy Staley, who runs track and just made the cheerleading team. ''We always have the first- or second-highest S.A.T. scores in Jefferson County. The reason so many kids were in the library yesterday is because they care about their grades. Everyone is always going in there to read.'' Amy's friend Kim Mohrbacher, who was standing nearby, chimed in: ''Fifty kids in our school have straight A's. Over 200 have a 3.8.'' Amy's mother, Sandy Staley, arrived outside the school just as Amy and her friends were talking about academics. The events of Tuesday have not even begun to sink in, Mrs. Staley said. ''They're worried that if school is closed, they won't be able to get their grades up,'' she said. ''They were saying, 'Are we going to get stuck with the grades we have now?' If they have a B, they want to get it up to an A.'' As for safety, Mrs. Staley said she had never worried about violence at the school. ''It's a big deal when someone throws eggs at your house on Halloween,'' she said. Metal detectors? No one even thought about installing them at Columbine, she said. They were for urban schools. Columbine's male athletes, tall, muscular and radiating confidence and authority in their Abercrombie shirts and jeans, stood out in today's crowd. It was easy to imagine their inspiring envy among some of their less popular classmates. ''We'd be walking down the hall, and people would say, 'Stupid jocks,' '' said Brad Johnson, 18, a senior who played for the football and rugby teams. ''I guess it's because they weren't jocks.'' Jason and Justin Baer, 16-year-old twins, and their brother Jarett, 15, are not jocks. It can be hard not being one of them at a sports-minded school like Columbine, they said. ''At the beginning of the semester, they made me clear their table in the cafeteria,'' said Jarett, who had his blond hair in short gelled spikes at the front. ''I was like, 'No.' They were like, 'Do it now.' I just lived with it.'' Whatever group people belonged to, everyone was welcome at the after-prom party last weekend. The theme was ''New York, New York.'' The parents had worked on it for a year. Today people were talking about the party, and the pep rally that preceded it, as if they were events from a vanished innocence. ''It was perfect,'' said Richard Colbert, 16, who plays guitar for a Christian music group, Ten String Lyre. ''Nobody got high. The week before, everyone signed prom contracts, saying they wouldn't drink, or drink and drive.'' The year before, a student had been killed in a car accident after the prom. But this year no one got hurt. It was considered another Columbine triumph.","Columbine High School is like lot of suburban high schools, proud of its high SAT scores and of its winning sports teams; it is like lot of suburban high schools in other ways as well; its 1,870 students are separated into cliques and classes and ins and outs, as complicated place as society beyond; photo (M)","1999-04-22T00:00:00Z","article","News","4fd224de8eb7c8105d7ab9ac",1026,"Good Grades, Good Teams and Some Bad Feelings","TERROR IN LITTLETON: THE SCHOOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(TCM) STAR OF THE MONTH: PETER SELLERSThroughout his career Sellers (1925-80) maintained that he had no personality and that, like an empty pitcher, he was merely waiting to be filled by his latest character. Or, as Bette Davis once put it, ''He isn't an actor, he's a chameleon.'' This 25-film tribute, Thursdays in January, starts with Sellers's international breakthrough, ''I'm All Right Jack'' (1959), a working-class comedy in which he plays a Marxist ideologue and union leader adorned with a Hitler mustache. In ''Heavens Above!'' (1963), at 10, he stars as a prison chaplain turned small-town vicar whose tendency to speak the truth shocks his conservative parishioners. In ''Two-Way Stretch'' (1960), at 12:15 a.m., he plays a pampered convict plotting to commit the perfect crime while still behind bars. ''The Ladykillers'' (1955), at 2, features Sellers (back row center above) as part of an outlaw gang that rents rooms in the home of an eccentric, elderly widow (Katie Johnson, front row center) while planning a major heist. And in ''Your Past Is Showing'' (1957), at 3:45, Sellers portrays one of several bumbling blackmail victims who join forces to do in their tormentor. 9 P.M. (ABC) GREY'S ANATOMY A mass shooting at a college sends the Seattle Grace doctors, their own wounds still mending, into action. In ''Private Practice,'' at 10, Addison (Kate Walsh) asks Dr. Rodriguez (Cristian de la Fuente) to help save her mother's partner. Meanwhile Pete (Tim Daly) and Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) run into complications when a patient's wife and his mistress can't agree on his course of treatment.
